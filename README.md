## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Search any by completing a controlled form
- There must be an option to sort movies by title and year
- If the input is valid only after a period of time the search must be made (debounce)

### What I learned

The main challenge of this exercise was to integrate the components on the work-flow. Since this exercise was a little bit extend, it was difficult to debug it. However, since the project was made following standard practices (modularization, linters, etc), only one component at a time needed to be checked.
